# A project submitted for Bosch intern final assignment about implementing basic CAN bus protocol

## Include of:
### Project1: Basic CAN Data Frame transmit with CRC field using J1850 algorithm
### Project2: DCM (Diagnostic Communication Manager) and UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services) with 3 services: 22, 27, 2E

## Preresiquites:
- Our project implement on a Open405R-C kit board (STM32), a pair of CAN bus modules plugged into both CAN1 and CAN2 port of the kit board, connected together with a pair of twisted wire, and debug on computer terminal via UART3 port using a UART module and tio CLI tool (but you can use any other serial monitor tool like Hercules, Terra Term). Programming and config clock, timing with STM32CubeIDE.
